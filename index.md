Machine learning today is like Hyrule, from the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; there are so many different areas to explore, from traditional areas like CV (computer vision), RL(reinforcement learning) and NLP(natural language processing), to more recent developments in AutoML, quantization, second-order tricks and many others. There's never been a better time to get into ML, and I've set up this blog to share some of my excitement by going over the ideas and developments in each of these fields. Each week, I'll be reviewing papers, breaking down the key ideas and framing them in simple terms; it'll be a mix of old classics and the avant-garde, to provide both historical context and the latest updates. My goal, 
with this blog, is twofold: (i) To provide a nice resource for people interested in learning more about ML (ii) To improve my own skills of reading research papers and communicating the key ideas in them.
