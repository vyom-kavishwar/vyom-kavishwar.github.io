# Who am I? (A bit more detailed than what's on the home page)

I'm Vyom Kavishwar, an Anglo-Indian in my 20s (born in Mumbai, spent half my childhood in London and the other half in Mumbai), currently studying at UC Berkeley as a Master's student.

I did my undergraduate education here too, and had a blast (which is why I'm still here!);as you can tell from the title of this blog, I'm very interested in machine learning, and I'm exploring how I can become more competent at it and carve out a career in the field (if you're interested in checking out my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/Resume_Vyom_Kavishwar_Fall_2019.pdf)). 

# Work and machine learning aside, what else defines me?

* *Chelsea*: I'm a lifetime supporter of the club (for those of you that don't know, it's a football/soccer club in the English Premier League); I try and watch matches when I can, and I'm always with the team in spirit. The happiest day of my life was probably the **19th of May, 2012**, when Chelsea won the Champions League by beating Bayern Munich (in their own backyard!) - an epic culmination to a season of pure grit and determination. 

* *Reading*: I absolutely love reading, and can pretty much devour anything (*Twilight/Fifty Shades aside*); my favourite authors are P.G. Wodehouse, Agatha Christie and J.K Rowling (not counting the Cursed Child)

* *Games*: I'm also into most kinds of games - board, social and video alike! My favourite video game of all time is definitely *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, so if you haven't played it - please, please get a Nintendo Switch! (I promise Nintendo hasn't sponsored me to write this, this blog's not nearly big enough yet). I also have a lot of fun with role-playing, deception-oriented games like Mafia, Avalon, Triple Agent and any others out there (make what you will of it!) 

* *Coffee*: As my friends will happily testify, coffee stocks have shot through the roof since I started drinking it four years ago! I'm always down for a cup of coffee (or Indian chai), and my quality of life is almost always directly proportional to how long it's been since my last coffee
